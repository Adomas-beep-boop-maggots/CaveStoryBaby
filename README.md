This repository is created purely for educational purposes.

Following tutorial "Remaking Cavestory in C++" by Limeoats
For now the only difference between Limeoats and my code is that I
fixed accruing probems with using "Visual studio 2019" and newer "Tiled" versions.
Probably gonna add more features when i finish this tutorial...
